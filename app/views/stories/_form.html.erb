<!-- this is called a partial, because this form is used on new and in edit, but it is only part of a webpage -->
<!-- we've just added the word simple to the top tag, to invoke the gem -->
<!-- simple form contains label convention and error messages, etc -->
<!-- Can change the auto labelling (like in link) to URL just by adding new info -->
